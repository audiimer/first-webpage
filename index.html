        <h2 id="first">Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>Audis Mercado Here! I'm originally from the beautiful island of Puerto Rico & I decided to move
            to the United States to live the American Dream. As for now, I'm working with the App Academy self
            taught Boot Camp to accomplish the goal of learning how to become a Full-Stack Software Developer.
        </p>

    <div class="content-b" id="content-letters">
        <h2 id="second">Wait, a Boot Camp all by yourself?!?!</h2>
        <p>Yes indeed! Before starting App Academy, I used to work at Amazon.com and ended up doing a Boot camp with
            them
            through their <a id="c-choice" href="https://www.amazoncareerchoice.com/home" target="_blank">Career
                Choice</a>
            program. It was offered by Merit America, a nonprofit organization. Through them, I earned the Google
            IT Support Professional Certificate. I wanted something more related to Software Engineering, but I didn't
            wanted
            to pay for a Boot camp just to have a coach and career experts helping me. Since I learned how that worked
            from the last Boot camp, I decided that I could do this one without the need of a coach or career mentor.
        </p>

    <div class="content-a" id="content-letters">
        <h2 id="third">So... what exactly is your Goal?</h2>
        <p>My Goal is to demonstrate myself that I can do whatever I want to achieve all my dreams and goals.
            With enough practice, determination, and consistency, I know that I will finish this Boot camp and
            land that job that I've always been dreaming of. Self doubt and Imposter Syndrome won't get me nowhere
            so it's time to trust myself and get to know my true potential that everyone sees in me.
